# SpiritCLI Core Architecture

> This document describes the complete internal architecture of the SpiritCLI engine.

---

# Purpose of This Folder

The `spirit/` directory contains the entire implementation of SpiritCLI.

Everything the user experiences through:

spirit scan
spirit watch
spirit push
spirit fix
spirit report

is implemented inside this directory.

This folder is divided into multiple subsystems.

Each subsystem is responsible for a specific feature and communicates with other subsystems through well-defined interfaces.

# Folder Documentation

<details>
<summary><strong>cli/ — Command Interface Layer</strong></summary>

---

## Purpose

This folder is responsible for translating user commands into actions.

Every command executed by the user enters the system through this layer.

Examples:

```bash
spirit scan
spirit watch
spirit push
spirit fix
spirit report
```

This layer contains no security logic.

It only validates arguments and forwards execution to the core engine.

---

### scan.py

Feature:

- spirit scan

Responsibilities:

- Parse scan arguments
- Validate target path
- Invoke scanner engine
- Display scan results

---

### watch.py

Feature:

- spirit watch

Responsibilities:

- Monitor file changes
- Trigger incremental scans
- Display live security feedback

---

### push.py

Feature:

- spirit push

Responsibilities:

- Run push validation
- Check fingerprint score
- Trigger push enforcement

---

### fix.py

Feature:

- spirit fix

Responsibilities:

- Run remediation engine
- Present patches
- Apply fixes

---

### report.py

Feature:

- spirit report

Responsibilities:

- Generate reports
- Export HTML
- Export JSON

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>core/ — Central Orchestration Layer</strong></summary>

## Why This Folder Exists

The core layer acts as the brain of SpiritCLI.

Every subsystem eventually passes through this folder.

Without this layer:

- modules become tightly coupled
- features become difficult to maintain
- testing becomes impossible

---

### engine.py

Most important file in the project.

Responsibilities:

- Initialize scans
- Manage execution order
- Coordinate all modules
- Aggregate results

Typical execution:

```text
engine.py

 ↓

scanner.py

 ↓

config analyzer

 ↓

dependency graph

 ↓

scoring

 ↓

reporting
```

---

### scanner.py

Responsible for:

- Full scans
- Incremental scans
- File collection

---

### findings.py

Defines:

```python
CriticalFinding
HighFinding
MediumFinding
LowFinding
```

Standardizes all findings.

---

### severity.py

Converts findings into severity levels.

Maps:

CVSS → Critical/High/Medium/Low

---

### fingerprint.py

Computes:

Security Health Fingerprint

Used by:

- report
- push
- watch

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>ast/ — Abstract Syntax Tree Analysis Engine</strong></summary>

# Purpose

The AST module is responsible for understanding source code.

Traditional scanners inspect only dependency manifests such as:

package.json
requirements.txt

SpiritCLI goes further.

It analyzes the actual application source code to understand:

- Which dependencies are imported
- Which APIs are being called
- Which configuration values are passed
- Which functions use specific dependencies

This module forms the foundation of:

- Configuration Context Analysis
- Phantom Dependency Detection
- Transitive Risk Tracing
- Auto Remediation

Without this module SpiritCLI would behave similarly to npm audit.

---

# Why AST Analysis Is Important

Consider:

```javascript
bcrypt.hashSync(password, 4);
```

A normal scanner sees:

```json
{
  "dependency": "bcrypt"
}
```

SpiritCLI sees:

```json
{
  "dependency": "bcrypt",
  "method": "hashSync",
  "parameter": "rounds",
  "value": 4
}
```

This additional context allows SpiritCLI to identify security issues that traditional tools miss.

---

# Execution Stage

Used By:

- visitors.py

Owner:

Lokesh

---

## visitors.py

# Purpose

Traverses AST nodes.

Similar to walking through a tree.

Example:

Program
│
├── ImportDeclaration
│
├── FunctionDeclaration
│
└── CallExpression

Responsibilities:

- Visit every node
- Collect interesting nodes
- Pass nodes to extractors

Detects:

- imports
- function calls
- object literals
- variable declarations

Used By:

- extractors.py

---

## extractors.py

# Purpose

Extract meaningful security data from AST nodes.

Example:

Input:

```javascript
bcrypt.hashSync(password, 4);
```

Output:

```json
{
  "library": "bcrypt",
  "method": "hashSync",
  "parameter": "rounds",
  "value": 4
}
```

Extracts:

- imports
- configurations
- function invocations
- dependency usage

Used By:

- config_analysis
- phantom detection
- dependency tracing

---

## patterns.py

# Purpose

Contains AST patterns used for detection.

Examples:

bcrypt patterns

JWT patterns

Axios patterns

Express patterns

Example:

```python
BCRYPT_HASH_PATTERN
JWT_SIGN_PATTERN
AXIOS_CREATE_PATTERN
```

Allows reusable detection logic.

Used By:

- extractors.py
- remediation/

---

# Outputs Produced

The AST module produces:

```json
{
 "imports":[...],
 "configurations":[...],
 "calls":[...]
}
```

These outputs are consumed by:

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>config_analysis/ — Configuration Context Analysis Engine</strong></summary>

# Purpose

This is the most important folder in SpiritCLI.

It implements the project's primary innovation.

Most security scanners ask:

"Does this dependency have a CVE?"

SpiritCLI asks:

"Is this dependency configured safely?"

---

# Example

Safe:

```javascript
bcrypt.hashSync(password, 12);
```

Unsafe:

```javascript
bcrypt.hashSync(password, 4);
```

Both use the same dependency version.

Traditional scanners see no difference.

SpiritCLI detects the security risk.

<summary><strong>dependency_graph/ — Dependency Relationship & Risk Tracing Engine</strong></summary>

# Purpose

This module understands how dependencies relate to each other.

Modern applications contain:

50–100 direct dependencies

and

500–2000 transitive dependencies.

SpiritCLI must determine:

- Which dependency introduced a vulnerable package
- Whether the vulnerable package is reachable
- Which functions are affected

---

# Example

Application

↓

payment-sdk

↓

bank-utils

↓

crypto-js

↓

MD5

SpiritCLI can trace:

processPayment()

↓

<details>
<summary><strong>provenance/ — Supply Chain Trust & Provenance Analysis Engine</strong></summary>

# Purpose

Traditional dependency scanners only answer:

"Is this package vulnerable?"

SpiritCLI also answers:

"Can this package be trusted?"

A package may have:

- No CVEs
- Recent releases
- Working functionality

and still be dangerous.

Examples:

- Malicious maintainer takeover
- Typosquatting attack
- Abandoned package
- Repository compromise
- Suspicious package publication

The provenance module evaluates the trustworthiness of dependencies before considering vulnerabilities.

---

# Why This Module Exists

Modern software supply-chain attacks are increasing.

Examples:

- XZ Utils Backdoor
- event-stream npm attack
- ua-parser-js compromise
- SolarWinds attack

Traditional scanners failed because:

✓ No CVE existed initially

SpiritCLI attempts to identify trust signals before a vulnerability is publicly disclosed.

<summary><strong>remediation/ — Smart Auto-Remediation Engine</strong></summary>

# Purpose

SpiritCLI should not only identify security problems.

It should help fix them.

The remediation engine generates:

- Configuration fixes
- Dependency fixes
- Manifest fixes

while maintaining developer control.

Nothing is modified automatically without review.

---

# Why This Module Exists

Traditional scanners provide:

"Problem found."

Developers must manually:

- Research fix
- Edit code
- Upgrade package
- Verify outcome

SpiritCLI automates most of this workflow.

---

# Example

Detected:

```javascript
bcrypt.hashSync(password, 4);
```

Suggested Fix:

```javascript
bcrypt.hashSync(password, 12);
```

<summary><strong>scoring/ — Security Health Fingerprint Engine</strong></summary>

# Purpose

The scoring module is responsible for converting hundreds of security findings into a single understandable metric called the:

Security Health Fingerprint

The purpose of this module is to answer:

"How secure is this project right now?"

Instead of overwhelming developers with dozens of findings, SpiritCLI produces a measurable security score ranging from:

0 → 100

This score becomes the central metric used by:

- spirit scan
- spirit watch
- spirit push
- spirit report

---

# Why This Module Exists

Most security tools generate:

- Long vulnerability lists
- Massive reports
- Thousands of warnings

Developers often ignore them.

SpiritCLI converts all findings into a meaningful score.

Example:

```text
Configuration Safety : 80
CVE Exposure         : 60
Trust Score          : 90
Freshness            : 75
Phantom Risk         : 85

Final Score          : 78
```

This makes security easier to understand and track over time.

---

# Security Fingerprint Formula

Current Design

Configuration Safety : 30%
CVE Exposure : 25%
Provenance Trust : 20%
Dependency Freshness : 15%
Phantom Risk : 10%

Formula:

Score =
(Config × 0.30)

- (CVE × 0.25)
- (Trust × 0.20)
- (Freshness × 0.15)
- (Phantom × 0.10)

  ***

# Security Zones

Safe Zone

71–100

Meaning:

Project is production ready.

---

Warning Zone

36–70

Meaning:

Moderate risk exists.

Developer review required.

---

Quarantine Zone

0–35

Meaning:

Critical security problems detected.

Pushes may be blocked.

<summary><strong>integrations/ — External Services & Data Source Integration Layer</strong></summary>

# Purpose

The integrations layer is responsible for communicating with external services.

SpiritCLI does not maintain its own vulnerability database.

Instead, it collects security intelligence from trusted external sources.

This folder acts as the bridge between:

SpiritCLI

and

External Security Ecosystem

---

# Why This Module Exists

SpiritCLI requires information that cannot be generated locally.

Examples:

- CVE databases
- Package registries
- Repository metadata
- Package publication history

Rather than hardcoding this information, SpiritCLI retrieves it dynamically.

<summary><strong>storage/ — Persistence & Historical Analysis Layer</strong></summary>

# Purpose

The storage layer is responsible for preserving SpiritCLI data across scans.

Without storage:

Every scan would be independent.

SpiritCLI would be unable to:

- Track trends
- Compare historical scans
- Generate trajectory reports
- Explain score changes

---

# Why This Module Exists

Many SpiritCLI features depend on historical information.

Examples:

Security Trend Analysis

Score Trajectory

Root Cause Detection

Push Audit History

These features require persistent storage.

---

# Execution Stage

Runs during:

Every scan

Every report

Every push

Every remediation

<summary><strong>models/ — Core Data Model Definitions</strong></summary>

# Purpose

The models layer defines the language spoken by SpiritCLI.

Every module exchanges information using models.

Without models:

Different modules would use inconsistent data formats.

This would make integration difficult.

---

# Why This Module Exists

Consider:

AST Analysis generates findings.

Reporting consumes findings.

Scoring consumes findings.

All must agree on the same structure.

Models provide that structure.

---

# Execution Stage

Used Everywhere.

Every subsystem imports models.

---

# Folder Structure

models/

├── finding.py
├── dependency.py
├── score.py
└── report.py

---

## finding.py

# Purpose

Represents a security finding.

Example:

```python
Finding(
 severity="critical",
 file="auth.js",
 message="JWT algorithm none"
)
```

Used By:

Nearly every module.

---

## dependency.py

# Purpose

Represents a dependency.

Example:

```python
Dependency(
 name="axios",
 version="1.5.0"
)
```

Supports:

- Dependency Graph
- Provenance
- Scoring

---

## score.py

# Purpose

Represents fingerprint scores.

Example:

```python
Score(
 total=78,
 zone="SAFE"
)
```

Used By:

- Reporting
- Git Enforcement

---

## report.py

# Purpose

Represents generated reports.

Contains:

- Findings
- Scores
- Trends

Acts as the final reporting model.

---

# Why Models Are Important

Benefits:

- Type Safety
- Consistency
- Easier Testing
- Easier Refactoring

<details>
<summary><strong>utils/ — Shared Utilities & Infrastructure Helpers</strong></summary>

# Purpose

The utilities folder contains reusable helper functions.

These are pieces of functionality used throughout the project but which do not belong to any specific feature.

---

# Why This Module Exists

Without utilities:

Code duplication increases.

Example:

Logging code repeated.

Configuration loading repeated.

Path handling repeated.

Utilities centralize these common tasks.

---

# Execution Stage

---

## logger.py

# Purpose

Central logging system.

Provides:

```python
logger.info()
logger.warning()
logger.error()
```

Used For:

- Debugging
- Monitoring
- Error tracking

Example:

```python
logger.warning(
 "Unsafe JWT configuration detected"
)
```

---

## constants.py

# Purpose

Stores project-wide constants.

Examples:

```python
SAFE_ZONE = 71
WARNING_ZONE = 36
QUARANTINE_ZONE = 0
```

Benefits:

- Avoid magic numbers
- Easier maintenance

---

## config.py

# Purpose

Load application configuration.

Example:

```yaml
scan:
  depth: 5
```

Responsibilities:

- Read config files
- Environment variables
- Runtime settings

---

## helpers.py

# Purpose

General helper functions.

Examples:

- File utilities
- Path utilities
- String utilities
- JSON helpers

Functions here should remain generic.

If a helper becomes feature-specific, it should move into that feature's folder.

---

# Best Practices

Allowed:

```python
helpers.load_json()
```

Not Allowed:

```python
helpers.calculate_fingerprint()
```

Feature-specific logic should never be placed in utils.

# Development Guidelines

## Adding a New Feature

1. Create feature folder
2. Add models
3. Add tests
4. Register command
5. Integrate with engine.py

---

# Dependency Rules

Allowed:

cli → core
core → ast
core → scoring
core → reporting

Forbidden:

reporting → ast
models → reporting
utils → core

This prevents circular dependencies.
